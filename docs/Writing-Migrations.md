Writing Migrations
==================
Migrations are little PHP scripts that define the changes that are to be made to your database whenever they are executed. The API for writing yentu migrations is designed to be as descriptive as possible. Through these scripts you can create tables and their associated objects (like columns), you can seed tables with data, and you can also execute raw SQL queries directly on the database.

Creating a migration
-----------------------------
To create a migration execute the following from your command line.

    $ php vendor/bin/yentu create users
    
Yentu will create a skeleton migration file, with a name similar to `20200726115141_users.php`, in the `yentu/migrations` directory. The contents of this file will look close to this:

````php
/**
 * Generated by yentu on 9th February, 2016 07:11:57
 */

begin()

->end();
````

It is worth noting that the numbers that 

Defining Tables
---------------
To add a table to this migration you can modify this code to look as follows:

````php
<?php
/**
 * Generated by yentu on 30th May, 2016 17:41:44
 */

begin()
  ->table('users')
    ->column('id')->type('integer')->nulls(false)
    ->column('username')->type('string')->nulls(false)
    ->primaryKey('id')
    ->autoIncrement()
->end();
````

Whenever you execute the migration command ...

    % php vendor/bin/yentu migrate

... a table called `users` with the specified columns will be created.
